##Problem Statement

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has given us a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. However, these customers do not have prior transaction history with the organisation.

We have to reveal useful customer insights which could help optimise resource allocation for targeted marketing. Hence, improve performance by focusing on high value customers.

The Program has divided the solution into three tasks.

1.Data Quality Assessment
2.Data Insights
3.Data Insights and Presentation

## Data Quality Assessment

The importance of optimising the quality of customer datasets cannot be underestimated. The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance we will be able to use it drive company growth.
